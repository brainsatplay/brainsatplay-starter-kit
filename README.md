 Brains@Play is a framework for rapid application development.

 This framework has been designed from the bottom-up to support **visual reactive programming**. In addition to our CLI, we have on-browser visualization and editing tools to support the authoring and remixing of ES Components by anyone with a browser.

## The Basics
[ESCompile](https://github.com/brainsatplay/escode/blob/main/libraries/escompose) is used in all demos to instantiate applications from **.esc.js** files.
