 This template repository will **get you started working with [Brains@Play](https://github.com/brainsatplay) and engaging with our mission to support Universal Web Development**.

 In particular, we highlight [escode]: a framework for rapidly prototyping high-performance applications.

 Our software has been designed from the bottom-up to support **visual reactive programming**. In addition to an advanced CLI, we have on-browser visualization and editing tools to support the authoring and remixing of ES Components by anyone with a browser.

## Installation
To take advantage of [escode] in your project, all you'll need to do is import the core [escompose] library, which instantiates applications from **.esc.js** files.

```js
import * as escompose from './libraries/escompose/index.esm.js'
```

## Getting Started
To create a functional [escode] application, you'll need to understand a few fundamental concepts:

### ES Components (.esc)
This is covered in the [hello world](./content/0-hello-world/index.esc.js) demo.

### Reactive Objects
This is covered in the [composition](./content/1-composition/index.esc.js) demo, which introduces **listeners**.

These can be triggered **inline** in your own code filesâ€”or configured **in .esc** format to produce shareable ES Components.

### Web Components
This is covered in the [web components](./content/2-web-components/index.esc.js) demo.

### Wrapping Existing APIs
This is covered in the [game development](./content/3-game-development/index.esc.js) demo, which usesthe Phaser (v3) API to create a game.

### Multimodal Control
This is covered in the previous demo and the [physiological signals](./content/4-physiological-signals/index.esc.js) demo.

### Next-Generation Documentation and Educational Websites
This is covered in the [education](./content/5-education/index.esc.js) file, which demonstrates how to organize text in an [escode] project and embed demos inside interactive visual editors.

## Acknowledgments
Brains@Play is led by [Garrett Flynn](https://github.com/garrettmflynn) and [Joshua Brewster](https://github.com/joshbrew), who use contract work and community contributions through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/brainsatplay) to support themselves.

The ongoing development of [escode] for the education of new generations of engineers and researchers has been generously supported by Chris Crawford at [Human Technology and Interaction Lab](https://htilua.org/) (HTIL) of the University of Alabama.
